Payment for prepaid phone plans is made upfront before the service is provided, while payment for regular phone plans is made regularly, usually on a monthly basis. Expiry times for prepaid and regular phone plans may also differ. Prepaid plans offer more flexibility, with short-term 7-day plans to 12-month long expiry prepaid plans. Regular phone plans usually last one or two years. At an additional cost, regular phone plans may also include a new phone. Other than these three key differences, both phone plans typically offer similar services such as unlimited calls, included data, and allocated time for international calls.\n\u003ch3\u003eAre prepaid phone plans a good idea?\u003c\/h3\u003e\nWhether a prepaid phone plan is a good idea is up to you and your preferences. Prepaid plans are paid upfront and deliver their services based on an expiry date. A prepaid service may include features such as unlimited standard national calls, data rollover, and auto recharge. Unlike a regular phone plan, prepaid phone plans rarely come with a phone for use.\n\u003ch3\u003eIs it cheaper to go prepaid or plan?\u003c\/h3\u003e\nIt is usually cheaper to go with a pre paid service rather than a regular plan. This is because a prepaid service is usually shorter and does not come with a phone.\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat are 12 months prepaid plans?\u003c\/h3\u003e\nA 12 month prepaid plan is a long expiry prepaid plan offering a multitude of valuable phone services.
